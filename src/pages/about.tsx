        Hey there, Iâ€™m Rohit! 20 year old full-Stack developer and freelancer
        based in India. Iâ€™ve taken coding seriously since 2023, and have been
        freelancing since 2024. Recently, however, Iâ€™ve grown a knack for giving
        back to community. I like contributing to ðŸ¤“ open source as a web
        developer, which is probably the reason why youâ€™ve ended up here.
        Currently struggling with blockchain and rust.
      </p>
