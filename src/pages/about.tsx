        Hey there, I’m Rohit! 20 year old full-Stack developer and freelancer
        based in India. I’ve taken coding seriously since 2024 I’ve grown a
        knack for giving back to community. I like contributing to 🤓 open
        source as a web developer, which is probably the reason why you’ve ended
        up here. Currently struggling with nothing actually.
